All data have been recorded with the Brain Vision Recorder software (Brain Products, Munich, Germany),
which supports the BrainVision Data Exchange Format only. This format is described in detail in the
Brain Vision Recorder manual (https://www.brainproducts.com/downloads.php?kid=2). Most importantly,
an EEG consists of three files: the header file, the marker file and the actual data. The headerfile describes the EEG.
This file is an ASCII file with the extension .vhdr. The format of the header file is based on the WindowsÂ® INI format.
The marker file with the extension .vmrk is based on the same principle of sections and keywords as the header file.
The first line identifies the marker file, as follows: Brain Vision Data Exchange Marker File Version 1.0.

For every participant we uploaded 4 (condition) x 3 (data, header, marker) files. The experiment included
four conditions, which were presented in randomized order:

In the perception condition, participants were prompted by an auditory cue presented 3 s after each noxious stimulus
to verbally rate the perceived pain intensity on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to
100 (worst tolerable pain). Pain ratings served as a measure of the perceptual dimension of pain.
The respective files are named: Exp_Mediation_Paradigm1_Perception_vpxx.eeg Exp_Mediation_Paradigm1_Perception_vpxx.vhdr
 Exp_Mediation_Paradigm1_Perception_vpxx.vmrk

In the motor condition, participants were instructed to release a button with the index finger of the right hand
as fast as possible in response to each noxious stimulus. Reaction times served as a measure of the
motor dimension of pain. The respective files are named: Exp_Mediation_Paradigm2_Motor_vpxx.eeg
Exp_Mediation_Paradigm2_Motor_vpxx.vhdr Exp_Mediation_Paradigm2_Motor_vpxx.vmrk

During the autonomic condition, participants were instructed to focus on the painful stimulation without any further
task while SCRs were recorded. SCRs served as a measure of the autonomic dimension of pain. The respective files are
named: Exp_Mediation_Paradigm3_EDA_vpxx.eeg Exp_Mediation_Paradigm3_EDA_vpxx.vhdr Exp_Mediation_Paradigm3_EDA_vpxx.vmrk

In the combined condition, the participants were asked to first release the button as fast as possible in response
to the noxious stimulus and then provide a pain rating. In addition, SCRs were recorded.

In each condition, 60 painful stimuli were applied to the dorsum of the left hand. Stimulus intensity was varied
between three individually adjusted levels (low [n=20], medium [n=20] and high [n=20]) in a pseudo-randomized sequence.
Stimuli were presented with an inter-stimulus interval of 8 - 12 sec.

The occurrence of all relevant events and reactions (noxious laser stimulation, rating, button release etc.) is noted
in the form of certain triggers and markers in the marker file. The additional excel-file
"Brain mediators of pain_overview triggers" (see uploaded files) specifies the sequence and meaning of all relevant
triggers and markers separately for the three conditions.
